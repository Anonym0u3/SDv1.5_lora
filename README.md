# Stable Diffusionv1.5 text-to-image fine-tuning

 `train_text_to_image.py` script from huggingface diffusers


## Running locally with PyTorch
### Installing the dependencies

Before running the scripts, make sure to install the library's training dependencies:

**Important**

To make sure you can successfully run the latest versions of the example scripts, we highly recommend **installing from source** and keeping the install up to date as we update the example scripts frequently and install some example-specific requirements. To do this, execute the following steps in a new virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install .
```

Then cd in the example folder  and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And initialize an [ðŸ¤—Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/) environment with:

```bash
accelerate config
```



## Training with LoRA

Low-Rank Adaption of Large Language Models was first introduced by Microsoft in [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) by *Edward J. Hu, Yelong Shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen*.

In a nutshell, LoRA allows adapting pretrained models by adding pairs of rank-decomposition matrices to existing weights and **only** training those newly added weights. This has a couple of advantages:

- Previous pretrained weights are kept frozen so that model is not prone to [catastrophic forgetting](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611835114).
- Rank-decomposition matrices have significantly fewer parameters than original model, which means that trained LoRA weights are easily portable.
- LoRA attention layers allow to control to which extent the model is adapted toward new training images via a `scale` parameter.

[cloneofsimo](https://github.com/cloneofsimo) was the first to try out LoRA training for Stable Diffusion in the popular [lora](https://github.com/cloneofsimo/lora) GitHub repository.

With LoRA, it's possible to fine-tune Stable Diffusion on a custom image-caption pair dataset
on consumer GPUs like Tesla T4, Tesla V100.

### Training

First, you need to set up your development environment as is explained in the [installation section](#installing-the-dependencies). Make sure to set the `MODEL_NAME` and `DATASET_NAME` environment variables. Here, we will use [Stable Diffusion v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) and the [Pokemons dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions).  

**___Note: Change the `resolution` to 768 if you are using the [stable-diffusion-2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2) 768x768 model.___**

**___Note: It is quite useful to monitor the training progress by regularly generating sample images during training. [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) is a nice solution to easily see generating images during training. All you need to do is to run `pip install wandb` before training to automatically log images.___**

```bash
export MODEL_NAME="CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
export DATASET_NAME="lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions"
```

For this example we want to directly store the trained LoRA embeddings on the Hub, so 
we need to be logged in and add the `--push_to_hub` flag.

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

Now we can start training!

```bash
accelerate launch --mixed_precision="bf16" --num_processes=1 --num_machines=1 --dynamo_backend=no train_text_to_image_lora.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_NAME \
  --dataset_name=$DATASET_NAME \
  --dataloader_num_workers=4 \
  --resolution=512 \
  --rank=4 \
  --center_crop \
  --random_flip \
  --train_batch_size=8 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps=4 \
  --max_train_steps=5000 \
  --learning_rate=1e-04 \
  --max_grad_norm=1 \
  --lr_scheduler="cosine" \
  --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
  --output_dir=${OUTPUT_DIR} \
  --checkpoints_total_limit=5 \
  --validation_prompt="A pokemon with blue eyes." \
  --num_validation_images=4 \
  --validation_epochs=30 \
  --seed=1337 \
  --enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention \
  --report_to="wandb" \
```

The above command will also run inference as fine-tuning progresses and log the results to Weights and Biases.

**___Note: When using LoRA we can use a much higher learning rate compared to non-LoRA fine-tuning. Here we use *1e-4* instead of the usual *1e-5*. Also, by using LoRA, it's possible to run `train_text_to_image_lora.py` in consumer GPUs like T4 or V100.___**


### Inference

Please refer to inference.py

### Training with xFormers:

You can enable memory efficient attention by [installing xFormers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/optimization/xformers) and passing the `--enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention` argument to the script.

xFormers training is not available for Flax/JAX.

**Note**:

According to [this issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/2234#issuecomment-1416931212), xFormers `v0.0.16` cannot be used for training in some GPUs. If you observe that problem, please install a development version as indicated in that comment.
